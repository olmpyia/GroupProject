# Laser Strike
Information on project:

(Not totally sure) Our project will be a video game similar to Geometry Dash, with possible levels and a storyline to keep the user active and involved. At the end of the possible levels, we might do a boss, as well, so that the user isn't playing a repetitive game and has more possible chances to die.

## Project Objective
Features and Goals:

This project will include a moveable character and obstacles to avoid. The moveable character will be a ball that is controlled with the commands (ex. WASD, arrow keys, mouse, etc.). The obstacles to be avoided are spikes, lasers, and blocks. All of this is in the hopes that the user, no matter their age, has fun at our game.
