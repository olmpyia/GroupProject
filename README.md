# PEMDASH
Information on project:

Our project will test players' PEMDAS skills with a speedrun twist. In this video game, players will have to jump over and dodge obstacles. The aim of the game is to reach the end in the fastest time possible. However, during their run, a math equation will pop up every few seconds. The timer continues to run even when solving the equation, and so both the players' gaming and math fluency skills are tested. Getting the question wrong will result in a lower score, and getting hit by obstacles will add "X" amount of seconds to their final time (in relation to size of the obstacle).

## Project Objective
Features and Goals:

This project will include a character that can jump over obstacles. Players will be able to control this character using either their mouse or the space key. The obstacles to be avoided are spikes and lasers of varying sizes. Power-ups are provided that will provide either a skip or shield to the player. The goal of this game is to improve math literacy in players of all ages and demographics, while still offering a fun, entertaining experience.
